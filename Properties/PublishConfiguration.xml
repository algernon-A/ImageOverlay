  <LongDescription>A simple mod to **Overlay an image on the game map**.

Includes the ability to quickly and easily select and change between different images for the overlay.  The size, position, rotation, and transparency of the overlay can also be adjusted.

Works both in-game and in the editor.

Requested by AmiPolizeiFunk to assist with map creation and real-life city recreation.

## Instructions
### Selecting the overlay files
- Place any desired overlays in ".png" format in the "Overlays" directory in your local settings (%LocalAppData%Low\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II).
- The images can be any size up to a maximum of 16 384 pixels in either dimension. The images don't *have* to be square, but it's best if they are; if not square, they will be stretched out to a square in-game.
- In the game's 'Settings' menu there will be a mod setting entry there for 'Image overlay' where you can choose the overlay image file that you want.
- You can change the overlay file at any time.  Press the 'refresh files' button to rescan the Overlays directory for changes (so you can add or remove overlay files even when in-game).

### Displaying the overlay
- Press **Control-O** to activate the overlay. Press **Control-O** again to hide it.  There may be a slight pause in the game on the first activation as the image file is loaded.
- The overlay will be automatically scaled to the vanilla playable area size (14 336m per side) and will be centred around middle of the map.
- The overlay is projected onto a flat and level plane at the elevation you set.  By default the overlay will still be visible if the plane is underneath the terrain, but this can be disabled in the options panel if you want to only show the overlay where it is above the terrain.

### Repositioning the overlay
- Press **Control-PageUp** and **Control-PageDown** to raise or lower the level of the overlay.
- To rotate the overlay, press **Control-.** (period) or **Control-,** (comma) to rotate 1 degree at a time, or press **Control-Shift** to rotate 90 degrees at a time.
- To move the overlay horizontally, use the **arrow keys** with either **Control** (move 1m at a time) or **Shift** (move 10m at a time).
- You can also use the sliders in the settings panel to change the position, elevation, and rotation.

### Resizing the overlay
- Press **Control-Minus** and **Control-Equals** to shrink or expand the size of the overlay.
- For large adjustments you can use the slider in the settings panel (you can use this to easily expand the overlay to cover the entire background terrain).

### Changing the overlay's transparency
- Use the slider in the settings panel to change the overlay's transparency. 0% (default) is fully opaque and 100% is fully transparent (invisible).
